<span id="id1"></span><h1>Reporting<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Upon completion of the hauler routing for every day in our data set, we are
left with three complete pieces of information.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>how much demand each site had each day (smoothed)</li>
<li>how many miles the fleet of haulers worked each day</li>
<li>how many hours each hauler worked each day</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All of this information we then compile into a report which can then be used
to make a calculation as to the cost of this variation&#8217;s of a region delivery
system.</p>
<div class="section" id="equipment-hauler-cost">
<h2>Equipment Hauler Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment-hauler-cost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step in the reporting process is to summarize how often each hauler
is utilized. Each day when we recorded the hours each hauler worked, we
assigned hours to haulers from greatest to least, so the first hauler got the
most hours, the second got the second most, etc. By doing this, when we
average how many hours each hauler works each day and how many days in a year
each hauler worked, we ensure the fewest amount of haulers do the greatest
amount of work. Based on how often each hauler is utilized a decision can be
made as to whether or not that hauler needs hired and his semi needs purchased,
or if overtime by other haulers can be worked to cover the extra drop-offs
and pick-ups. Later in the reporting process, this decision can be reinforced
by graphs mapping out how much each hauler works on each day, telling us
whether or not such an overtime strategy would be effective in replacing a
given equipment hauler. With this information we can calculate how many
haulers and semi-trucks we need to meet our demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="semi-truck-cost">
<h2>Semi-Truck Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#semi-truck-cost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next we can induce how often the semi-trucks in our delivery system will need
replaced, based on how many miles they run each day. If we sum the fleet
mileage table over all days in our time range, we can use that number to
forecast when a fleet of semi-trucks will need replaced.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equipment-sets-cost">
<h2>Equipment Sets Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment-sets-cost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One final crucial piece of information has yet to be determined for making
our cost calculation, and that is how many sets of equipment will be needed
for this system to work. For each day in our time range, we repeated the
following process:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If a set of equipment is at a site, mark it as in use. If it gets
picked up from that site later in the day, it is still being used as it
either goes to another site or spends the day returning to the hub.</li>
<li>If a site has a demand for equipment to be picked-up, assign that
number of that site&#8217;s sets of equipment to be free for usage elsewhere.</li>
<li>If a site has a demand for equipment to be dropped-off, assign that
number of sets of equipment to that site. This can include
the sets of equipment that were just released, as haulers can meet one
site&#8217;s demand for drop-offs by picking-up from a site that released
equipment on that day.</li>
<li>If a set of equipment is at a site, mark it as in use. We repeat this
step to ensure that additional sets of equipment that were brought out
to job sites, if necessary, are counted as in use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also worth nothing in the process, the sets of equipment are indexed in
increasing order, and assignment is made to the set of available equipment
with the lowest index, ensuring we use the smallest number of equipment sets
for the majority of the work.</p>
<p>From here we make two graphs to illustrate the machine set usage. The first
graph depicts how often each set of equipment gets used, helping us decide
whether or not a given set of equipment should be bought or rented. The
second graph shows us how much additional utility each set of equipment adds,
further detailing how many equipment sets are needed to meet the demand. With
this information, we can now infer how many sets of construction equipment
are needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decision">
<h2>Decision<a class="headerlink" href="#decision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point, all of the above information is compiled into a single report
corresponding to the given variation of a region, and can be used to calculate
the cost of this variation&#8217;s delivery system. Providing that there exists at
least one variation in each region that costs less than the current state of
that variation, it would be advised that the construction company change
their equipment transportation method to the internal delivery system.</p>
