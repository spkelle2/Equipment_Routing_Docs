<p>Upon completion of the hauler routing for every day in our data set, we are
left with three complete pieces of information.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>how much demand each site had each day (smoothed)</li>
<li>how many miles the fleet of haulers worked each day</li>
<li>how many hours each hauler worked each day</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All of this information we then compile into a report which can then be used
to make a calculation as to the cost of this variation&#8217;s delivery system.</p>
<div class="section" id="equipment-hauler-cost">
<h2>Equipment Hauler Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment-hauler-cost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step in the reporting process is to summarize how often each hauler
is utilized. Each day when we recorded the hours each hauler worked, we
assigned hours to haulers from greatest to least, so the first hauler got the
most hours, the second got the second most, etc. By doing this, when we
average how many hours each hauler works each day and how many days in a year
each hauler worked, we ensure the fewest amount of haulers do the greatest
amount of work. Based on how often each hauler is utilized a decision can be
made as to whether or not that hauler needs hired and his semi needs purchased,
or if overtime by other haulers can be worked to cover the extra drop-offs
and pick-ups. Later in the reporting process, this decision can be reinforced
by graphs mapping out how much each hauler works on each day, telling us
whether or not such an overtime strategy would be effective in replacing a
given equipment hauler. With this information we can calculate how many
haulers and semi-trucks we need to meet our demand.</p>
<p>For example, the image below illustrates what the results of this summary
might look like. It&#8217;s pretty easy to tell that the last three haulers
probably do not need hired. The second image typifies the graph that maps
how much each hauler works each day, and supports the last three not being
hired as <span class="math">\(4\)</span>&#8216;s hours are pretty spread out, could be covered by another
hauler working extra, and are greater than <span class="math">\(5\)</span>&#8216;s and <span class="math">\(6\)</span>&#8216;s.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="semi-truck-cost">
<h2>Semi-Truck Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#semi-truck-cost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next we can induce how much needs spent on equiping our haulers with semi-
trucks. We already know how many trucks will be needed (as we would like one
for each hauler), but another part of the cost comes from how often we have
to replace the semi-trucks based on how many miles they run per period of
time. This part of the calculation can be made by summing the total number
of miles the fleet runs each day for our time period. This number then can be
used to forecast how many times semi-trucks would need to be repurchased over
a long range of time. An example of this number appears at the top of the
first image.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equipment-sets-cost">
<h2>Equipment Sets Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment-sets-cost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One final crucial piece of information has yet to be determined for making
our cost calculation, and that is how many sets of equipment will be needed
for this system to work. For each day in our time range, we repeated the
following process:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If a set of equipment is at a site, mark it as in use. If it gets
picked up from that site later in the day, it is still being used as it
either goes to another site or spends the day returning to the hub.</li>
<li>If a site has a demand for equipment to be picked-up, assign that
number of that site&#8217;s sets of equipment to be free for usage elsewhere.</li>
<li>If a site has a demand for equipment to be dropped-off, assign that
number of sets of equipment to that site. This can include
the sets of equipment that were just released, as haulers can meet one
site&#8217;s demand for drop-offs by picking-up from a site that released
equipment on that day.</li>
<li>If a set of equipment is at a site, mark it as in use. We repeat this
step to ensure that additional sets of equipment that were brought out
to job sites, if necessary, are counted as in use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also worth noting in the process, the sets of equipment are indexed in
increasing order, and assignment is made to the set of available equipment
with the lowest index, ensuring we use the smallest number of equipment sets
for the majority of the work.</p>
<p>From here we make two graphs to illustrate the machine set usage. The first
graph depicts how often each set of equipment gets used, helping us decide
whether or not a given set of equipment should be bought or rented. The
second graph shows us how much additional utility each set of equipment adds,
further detailing how many equipment sets are needed to meet the demand. With
this information, we can now infer how many sets of construction equipment
are needed as well as how much each set will cost (difference in buying vs.
paying per use with renting). An example of the first graphic is shown below.</p>

<div class="section" id="decision">
<h2>Decision<a class="headerlink" href="#decision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point, all of the above information is compiled into a single report
corresponding to the given variation of a region, and can be used to calculate
the cost of this variation&#8217;s delivery system. For an example of what a final,
compiled report looks like, I invite you to download <a class="reference download internal" href="_downloads/morton_base_report.pdf" download=""><code class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">pdf</span></code></a>. There are two things I&#8217;d like to point out at this
time about making the calculation on total cost. The graphs above and in the
report give no recommendation on how many assets to buy, as it was preferred
by the construction company to interpret themselves. There is also no unit
cost listed for any of the assets as the company asked that the finances of
their potential investments be kept private. However, the report that the
code saves at the end, like the one available to download, can be used for
figuring out how many of each asset is necessary for a delivery system and,
with one&#8217;s own financial assumptions, an estimation on cost can be made.</p>
<p>Providing that there exists at least one variation in each region that costs
less than the current process of transporting equipment sets, it would be
advised that the construction company change their equipment transportation
method to the internal delivery system.</p>
<p>With a full means now of understanding how a decision can be made, I invite
you to look at my closing remarks on the project.</p>
